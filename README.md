# Pi-hole Network Security Project ‚Äì DNS Filtering with Raspberry Pi  

## üîç Project Overview  

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a **network-wide DNS-based ad blocker** using Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. The objective was to improve browsing performance, enhance network security, and showcase the versatility of the Raspberry Pi by implementing privacy-focused DNS filtering.  

We created a full video walkthrough that includes installing the Pi-hole software, configuring it on the network, testing ad blocking capabilities across devices, and integrating it with a VPN for remote protection.

## üìå Core Project Goals  

- Block intrusive ads, trackers, and malicious domains at the DNS level  
- Improve privacy and browsing speed across the home network  
- Use open-source tools to reduce attack surface  
- Educate others on how DNS filtering works  
- Demonstrate security applications for Raspberry Pi devices

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts  

Pi-hole is a simple yet powerful tool to protect and monitor home networks. This project not only improved the security and privacy of our network but also gave us a better understanding of how DNS works and how to implement practical cybersecurity solutions using low-cost hardware like the Raspberry Pi.
